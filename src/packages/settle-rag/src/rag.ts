 * wrap`), so each line breaks at the last place that fits; to make that the
 * chosen break, every later place on the same line that would still fit is
 * forbidden. Only layouts the browser can reproduce that way count: a line
 * and the one after it must not fit together, and a break after a dash,
 * which cannot be forbidden, must not fit on a line that should end earlier.
 * A word wider than the measure gets a line of its own, at a high cost, as
 * the browser would set it.
 *
 * `metrics.x` is where each character starts on one unbroken line. Returns
 * `null` only for text with nowhere to break.
