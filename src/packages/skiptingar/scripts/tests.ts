/**
 * How many tests the package has, read from a real run and not typed in.
 * Runs `bun test` on the package's folder, reads the summary Bun prints
 * (`N pass`, `N fail`, `Ran N tests across N files`) and writes `tests.json`,
 * which the playground's reference section reads. Failures are written down
 * as they are: the page never shows a green count over a red run.
 *
 * `bun run tests:count` from the repo root. Bun prints the summary on stderr,
 * so both streams are read. `errors` counts errors outside any test, such as a
 * test file that failed to load; Bun leaves those out of `fail`.
